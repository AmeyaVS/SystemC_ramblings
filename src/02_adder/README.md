## This folder constains the sample of a full adder with a traces and testbench.

* Files:
	- `half_adder.h/cpp`: SystemC module implementation of half_adder.
	- `full_adder.h/cpp`: SystemC module implementation of full_adder.
	- `driver.h/cpp`: SystemC module for generating the test vector for Full Adder.
	- `monitor.h/cpp`: SystemC module for monitoring the test vectors for DUT Full Adder.
	- `full_adder_main.cpp`: SystemC module which connects the Full Adder module with driver and monitor module,
		and also contains the sc_main needed to run the simulation by the SystemC libraries.
	- `Makefile`: Using make to build and run this SystemC simulation.(**Will be
	  removed later**).
	- `CMakeLists.txt`: CMake Support to build this example.

**Note:**
* Use the vcd_hier_manip tool which can be cloned from
[here](https://github.com/yTakatsukasa/vcd_hierarchy_manipulator.git)

* After cloning do these steps to build and install it.
	1. make
	2. export PATH=$PATH:$PWD

* Use this tool as:
    ```sh
    vcd_hier_manip <input_vcd_file.vcd>
    ```
	where <input_vcd_file.vcd> is the input vcd trace generated by full_adder testbench.

**Note:** This tool will change the input vcd trace file if you want to keep it same as before please use it this way:

    ```sh
    vcd_hier_manip <input.vcd> --output <output.vcd>
    ```
 
 where:
 - <input.vcd> input vcd trace file name
 - <output.vcd> output vcd trace file name.

* Use gtkwave to view the waveform generated.
    ```sh
    gktwave <input.vcd>
    ```

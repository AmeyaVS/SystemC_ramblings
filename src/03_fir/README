This Folder contains an example of an FIR filter design.

Files:
	fir.h/cpp: Source files for the SystemC FIR filter design.
	tb.h/cpp: Source files for the SystemC fir module testbench.
	firsytemmain.cpp: Source file for instantiating the fir and the testbench module and connecting them together for running the Simulation.
	golden/ref_output.dat: Reference output for comparing the results with the simulation results.
	Makefile: use make to build the project and execute the simulation.

1. run make to build the example.
2. It would build the project and run the simulation.
3. The simulation generates an output file output.dat which is compared with the golden/ref_output.dat file after simulation ends.
4. If both files are identical then the simulation has completed successfully otherwise not.

Instead of generating the test vectors manually using code, one can actually read a file of samples required for the FIR filter input, 
and pass it to the FIR filter via the tb.cpp source file.
Note: For the variable input one needs corresponding output file in the golden directory and necessary changes have to be made in the Makefile for the same.

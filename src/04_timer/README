This folder contains the example of a 8-Bit Timer design.

Files:
	timer.h/cpp: Source files for the SystemC Timer module.
	timer_tb.h/cpp: Source files for the SystemC Timer test-bench module.
	defines.h: Common Header file setting up the Timer parameters.
	main_timer_check.cpp: The Source file for the Timer module and the testbench instantiation.
	Makefile: Used to build the project.

1. run make to build and run the project.
2. Observe the output using the two implementation of the source method in the timer_tb.cpp file.

Note: while running the simulation for longer duration it can lead to exponentially growing vcd trace file.

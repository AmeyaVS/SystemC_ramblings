# SystemC_ramblings

This project will collect the SystemC samples and some models on which I will be working on.

Please do help in contributing back to it.

1. To download, build and install SystemC library use the build.sh script located in the resources folder.
	$ cd resources
	$ sh build.sh

2. After build and installation copy the contents of the SystemC.config generated by the script to the end of .bashrc
3. Source the .bashrc file or restart your bash terminal to make changes effectively.
4. The src folder contains the sample SystemC source code modules.
	Note: Please read the individual README located in each project folder in the src directory for better understanding the module.
